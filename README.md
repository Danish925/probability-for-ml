# 📘 Probability for Machine Learning

This repository contains my **personal learning notes and Jupyter notebooks**
focused on the **probability and statistics foundations required for Machine Learning and Data Science**.

The goal of this repository is to build **strong intuition** for how uncertainty,
data, and statistical reasoning are handled in ML — not to focus on exam-style
derivations or heavy mathematical proofs.

## 🎯 Why Probability for ML?

Machine Learning systems operate under **uncertainty**:
- Data is noisy
- Samples are limited
- Outcomes are never perfectly predictable

Probability and statistics provide the tools to:
- Model uncertainty
- Reason about data behavior
- Evaluate models correctly
- Make data-driven decisions

This repository documents my **step-by-step learning journey** in probability
from an ML perspective.
